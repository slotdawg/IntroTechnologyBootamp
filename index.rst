Getting Started
---------------

Welcome to the Nutanix Intro Technology Bootcamp! This workbook accompanies an instructor-led virtual session that introduces Nutanix Core technologies and many common management tasks.

You will explore Prism Element and become familiar with its features and navigation. You will use Prism to perform basic cluster administration tasks, including storage and networking. You will also walk through basic VM deployment and management tasks with Prism and AHV. The instructor explains the exercises and answers any additional questions that you may have.

At the end of the bootcamp, attendees should understand the Core concepts and technologies that make up the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud stack and should be well prepared for a hosted or onsite proof-of-concept (POC) engagement.
